# Privacy Policy for Random Prompts Generator Chrome Extension

**Last Updated: November 17, 2024**

## Introduction

Random Prompts Generator ("we", "our", or "the extension") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how our Chrome extension handles information.

## Information Collection and Use

### Data We DO NOT Collect

Random Prompts Generator is designed with privacy as a core principle. We want to be absolutely clear:

- **We do NOT collect any personal information**
- **We do NOT track your browsing activity**
- **We do NOT send any data to external servers**
- **We do NOT use cookies or tracking technologies**
- **We do NOT share any information with third parties**
- **We do NOT display advertisements**
- **We do NOT require user accounts or authentication**

### Data Stored Locally

The extension stores the following information **locally on your device only** using Chrome's local storage API:

1. **Saved Prompts**: When you click the "Save" button, the prompt text is stored in your browser's local storage
2. **No Synchronization**: Saved prompts are NOT synced across devices or uploaded to any server

This local data storage is used solely to provide you with the ability to save your favorite prompts for later reference.

## Permissions Explained

The extension requests the following permission:

### Storage Permission
- **Purpose**: To save your favorite prompts locally on your device
- **Scope**: Local storage only (not synced storage)
- **Data Access**: Only data created by the extension itself

The extension does **NOT** request or use:
- Access to your browsing history
- Access to your bookmarks
- Access to tabs or websites you visit
- Access to your downloads
- Network access to external servers
- Your location
- Your identity or email address

## How We Use Your Data

Since we don't collect any data, there is nothing to use, share, or sell. All prompt generation happens:

1. **Locally**: All code runs in your browser
2. **Offline**: The extension works without internet connection
3. **Privately**: Generated prompts never leave your device unless you explicitly copy and paste them elsewhere

## Data Security

- All data is stored using Chrome's secure storage API
- No data transmission occurs over the internet
- No external servers or databases are used
- Your saved prompts remain on your device until you delete them

## Your Control Over Data

You have complete control over your data:

1. **Delete Individual Prompts**: Click the delete icon next to any saved prompt
2. **Clear All Data**: Use the "Clear All" button in the Saved Prompts section
3. **Uninstall**: Removing the extension will delete all locally stored data

## Children's Privacy

The extension does not knowingly collect any information from anyone, including children under 13. Since no data is collected, the extension is safe for users of all ages.

## Third-Party Services

The extension does NOT:
- Integrate with any third-party services
- Load external scripts or resources
- Use analytics services
- Display advertisements
- Connect to social media platforms

## Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be reflected in the "Last Updated" date at the top of this policy. Continued use of the extension after changes constitutes acceptance of the updated policy.

## Open Source Transparency

The extension's source code is available for review, demonstrating our commitment to transparency and privacy.

## Data Retention

- **Saved Prompts**: Retained until you manually delete them or uninstall the extension
- **No Server Data**: Since no data is sent to servers, there is no server-side retention

## Your Rights

Since we don't collect personal data, traditional data rights (access, deletion, portability) don't apply. However, you maintain full control over any locally stored prompts through the extension's interface.

## Contact Information

If you have questions or concerns about this Privacy Policy:

- Chrome Web Store Developer Program Policies
- General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) principles
- California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) principles
- Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA)

## Consent

By installing and using Random Prompts Generator, you consent to this Privacy Policy.

## Summary

**In Plain English:**
- We don't collect, store, or transmit any of your personal information
- Everything stays on your device
- We can't see what prompts you generate or save
- No tracking, no ads, no data sharing
- You're in complete control
