            <h4 class="font-semibold text-gray-900 mb-2">What's the difference between a story starter and a writing prompt?</h4>
            <p class="text-gray-700 text-sm">
              While both are designed to inspire creativity, story starters specifically focus on opening lines or scenarios that begin a narrative, while writing prompts can be broader concepts, themes, or complete story ideas. Story starters give you the first moment of your story, leaving you to develop what comes next.

            <p class="text-gray-700 text-sm">
              Absolutely! All story starters generated by our tool are free to use for any purpose, including commercial publication. The story you develop from these starters is entirely your own original work.

            <p class="text-gray-700 text-sm">
              Don't overthink it! Generate a starter and immediately begin writing whatever comes to mind. The goal is to get words on the page. You can always revise later—the important thing is breaking through the initial creative barrier.
